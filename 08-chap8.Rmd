# Conclusion {#conc}

In this thesis I have gone in depth into the methodology and results of cluster zero-inflation models built in a Bayesian framework. The work departed from that of a traditional statistical modeling paper in that it was just as concerned with understanding and appreciating the procedural aspects of the method as it was with the results. 

## Limitations

I now consider the scope of the research done in this thesis.
