This thesis considers modeling situations where the data exhibits two distinctive features: the response variable is "zero-inflated", and the data is "clustered". I take zero-inflated to mean that values of the response are either zero or belong to a strictly positive continuous distribution, and I take clustered to mean that there is a meaningful grouping in the data structure that makes points within clusters similar. The thesis focuses primarily on building the models in a Bayesian frame and is just as interested in understanding the procedural aspects of doing so as it is in dissecting the results. In this way this work departs from the majority of statistical modeling literature as it seeks to highlight the ways in which a model can be valuable beyond the results that it produces. An extensive simulation was run with the aim of understanding how the performance of these models changes as we vary the sample size, the number of total clusters, and the quality of the priors used. While we find that the Bayesian model performs very similarly to it's Frequentist counterpart in terms of traditional performance metrics, we also lay out and describe the ways in which the additional conceptual work associated with building Bayesian models has the capacity to promote greater intentionality and understanding in a model building workflow. Finally, we introduce the developmental version of an R software package that aims to reduce the computational burden of executing methods like prediction and summary for these zero-inflation models.
