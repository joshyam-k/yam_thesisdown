I'd like to thank my advisors Lenny Wainstein and Kelly McConville for their significant support, insight, and kindness throughout this thesis process. I'm also extremely grateful for the guidance and mentorship of Jonathan Wells, Kristin Bott, Simon Couch, and Grayson White who were each uniquely integral to my time studying Statistics at Reed.
